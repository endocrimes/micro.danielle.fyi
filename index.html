			 <p>I made it outside with my 500C/M today - despite recovering from a flu+covid double vax 💉💉.</p>
<p>I forgot how good shooting film is for my brain. Time for some moody b/w to go alongside Berlin&rsquo;s overcast season 😅</p>

			 <p>I think I would like to switch back to a split #keyboard for the majority of my work typing but I can&rsquo;t decide if I should just buy a moonlander (easy, decent software guaranteed) or if i should investigate the current state of funky hipster split diy designs 😅</p>

			 <p>We re-watched Legally Blonde last night and honestly I&rsquo;m still amazed by how well that movie aged.</p>
<p>Even with some of the plot points that many others failed to do well, not a single scene needs &ldquo;ah but it was of its time!!!&rdquo; excuses for bigotry - and 22 years later still manages to be&hellip; comforting?</p>

In times like these it feels like a moral imperative to protest against those who take their marginal plurality and use it to fuel their attempts at a culture war.</p>
<p>The CDU and their SPD collaborators want to scrap bike lanes and build a highway through the city - we say no.</p>

<p>This recent trip to Brocken/Harz National Park was definitely one of those where the joy was drained out of you. They kill many of the lower trees and just&hellip; leave them to rot&hellip; to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; nearby commercial forests from bugs - and this is the result 😔.</p>
