The primary window runs at an angle from the top right to the bottom left of the frame. The windows are scratched and dirty. Their are many reflections of people walking, other buildings and benches. The window to the left that acts as a roof has patterns caused by the falling of light through trees. It invokes a slightly uncomfortable feeling through the grunginess.\">\n",
